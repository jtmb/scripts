# Discord Spam Scripts

This repository contains scripts to send messages to a Discord channel using webhooks.

## Scripts

### custom_message.sh

This script sends a predefined custom message to a Discord channel.

#### Usage

```sh
./custom_message.sh <DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL>
```

### evil_insult.sh

This script sends a random insult as a message from the evil insult api.

#### Usage

```sh
./evil_insult.sh <DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL>
```

### Discord Webhook Scanner Script

#### Usage

To scan a specific GitHub repository for webhooks:

```bash
./find_webhook.sh --repo <username>/<repository>
```

Example:

```bash
./find_webhook.sh --repo jtmb/qbit-monitor
```

This will fetch the latest commits from the `jtmb/qbit-monitor` repository and search for any Discord webhooks.

#### Scan Random Repositories

To scan random repositories on GitHub:

```bash
./find_webhook.sh --random
```

This will continuously scan random repositories on GitHub and search for potential webhooks in their commits. You can adjust the interval between scans in the script.

#### Continuous Scanning

The script is designed to loop indefinitely when scanning random repositories. You can stop the script at any time using `Ctrl + C`.

#### Optional: Customize Scan Interval

You can customize the frequency of scanning by adjusting the `sleep` duration in the script. This will control how long the script waits between each scan.

#### Script Options

- `--repo <username>/<repository>`: Specify a GitHub repository to scan (e.g., `jtmb/qbit-monitor`).
- `--random`: Scan random repositories from GitHub.

#### Example Output

When a webhook is detected, the script will send a Discord notification, and you will see an output like:

```
⚠️ A Discord webhook was detected in a commit!
Webhook Detected
A potential Discord webhook was found in the repository jtmb/qbit-monitor.
